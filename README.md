### Hi there, welcome to my Github Page ðŸ‘‹

My name is Claudio GonÃ§alves, and I am a brazilian Data Scientist, living in Florida. I am a passionate coder that is in constant learning. I started in R for most of my graduation, and I (not so recently) feel in love with Python, and am exploring this passion.
I am a Statistician bachelor and a master in Data Science.

I do a lot of stuff, some random, some not, and I hope you find something interesting. :v: 

### What do I do?

Right now I am building a trader system, I am learning some HTML and CSS for some python programing too. I am learning different stuff too, like the Kali Linux system and better working with servers. 


I love martial-arts, hiking, traveling and cooking etc. I'm a strong believer in the importance of ðŸ’š ecology, and especially reducing waste at a personal level and local and national political actions. I am very passionate abou politics, but I do reign over this passion.  I'm a big fan of memes, :tv: various TV shows, movies, :video_game: video-games and :game_die: fantasy. I still play Gurps with friends.

### My gear!! 

ðŸ’» I work on Samsumg laptops using Ubuntu 20.04 (soon to trying another one) and a custom Desktop, running Windows 10 (for gaming and trading) and a ubuntu server. Nowadays I program mostly on PyCharm and I use for the longest R-Studio.

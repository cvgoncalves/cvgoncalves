### Hi there, welcome to my Github Page ðŸ‘‹

My name is Claudio GonÃ§alves, and I am a brazilian Data Scientist, living in Florida. I am a passionate coder that is in constant learning. I started in R for most of my graduation, and I (not so recently) feel in love with Python, and am exploring this passion.
I am a Statistician bachelor and a master in Data Science.

I do a lot of stuff, some random, some not, and I hope you find something interesting. :v: 

### What do I do?

Right now I am working at Amerilife as a Data Scientist! 


I love martial-arts, hiking, traveling and cooking etc. I'm a strong believer in the importance of ðŸ’š ecology, and especially reducing waste at a personal level and local and national political actions. I am very passionate abou politics, but I do reign over this passion.  I'm a big fan of memes, :tv: various TV shows, movies, :video_game: video-games and :game_die: fantasy. I still play Gurps with friends.
